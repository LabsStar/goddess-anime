# Topgg Voting Route Not Used

</div>

## Why?

Currently we are awaiting the approval of our bot on top.gg. Once we are approved, we will be able to use this route.

## Why don't we just have a route for top.gg and one for discordbotlist.com?

We want to be ***only*** using [top.gg](https://top.gg) as it is the most popular bot list. We will not be using [discordbotlist.com](https://discordbotlist.com) as it is not as popular as [top.gg](https://top.gg).
