# Forms Developer Command

This command will allow developers of the bot to check forms that are submitted by users.

## Usage

```
dev/forms [-t <type>] [-c caseId]
```
`-t` is the type of form to check. If not specified, it will throw an error.

`-c` is the case ID of the form to check. If not specified, it will throw an error.

## Examples

```
dev/forms -t beta -c 64c8200baa21e29c31a9c7b0
```

# Types

The current types of forms are:

- `beta` - Beta Tester Form

# Case ID

We use MongoDB's ObjectID for case IDs. You can find the case ID by going to the form's response in the database and copying the `_id` field.
