# Setting an Anime Card Spawn Channel

To configure a designated channel for anime card spawns, you need to have the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission. Follow the steps below to set up the anime card spawn channel using the `setchannel` command:

```
/setspawn <channel>
```
Replace `<channel>` with the desired channel where you want the anime cards to spawn. Ensure that the channel is accessible to all users who should be able to interact with the anime cards. This command allows you to centralize the card spawning process and provide a dedicated location for users to engage with the anime cards. Enjoy the excitement of collecting and exploring your favorite anime characters in the specified channel!
