# Setting up Your Environment

Before you begin working with Goddess Anime, it's essential to configure your environment properly. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version from the official Node.js website.

2. Verify the installation by opening your preferred terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

   ````bash
   $ node --version
   ````
    This command will display the version of Node.js installed on your system. Make sure it meets the requirement `v18.16.0`.


3. Additionally, you will need a package manager such as npm or Yarn to manage the project's dependencies. By default, Node.js comes with npm.

Verify the installation of npm by running the following command:

````bash
   $ npm --version
````

Make sure the version of npm meets the requirement `9.7.1`.

4. Once you have verified that Node.js and npm are installed, you are ready to proceed with the next steps in the Goddess Anime setup process.

By completing these steps, you will have a properly configured environment to work with Goddess Anime.
